# DNS resolver

A toy DNS resolver. It resolves IP addresses for domains.

## Rationale

I wanted to learn about DNS and prefer to learn theory with practice. [Implement DNS in a weekend](https://implement-dns.wizardzines.com/) and the [How DNS works zine](https://wizardzines.com/zines/dns) by Julia Evans allow me to play with DNS and understand the technology.
